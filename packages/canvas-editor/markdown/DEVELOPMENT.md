## Type Naming Rules.

1. `-props`: When props is added as a suffix, the type indicates the type corresponding to props and is composed of an interface.

2. `-type`: When type is added as a suffix, the type indicates a type composed of `type`.

3. `I-`: When `I-` is added as a prefix, it indicates a type composed of an interface.

## Type Folder Rules.

1.  package's type file is in `types` folder.

2.  Classified according to `interface` and `type`.
    - e.g. `/fonts/type` : this is file about type.
    - e.g. `/fonts/interface` : this is file about interface.
